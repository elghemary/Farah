The simplex method is one of the best ways to optimize a real-life problem. As a mathematics undergraduate, this is how I first discovered this algorithm. However, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of the complicated calculations involved. First, It didn't make any sense, But everything changed when I started visualizing the calculations in terms of vectors and planes, everything click into place.

 In this Article, I want to share my understanding of the simplex method, and show you how to use Linear Algebra to think about it in an intuitive way. Whether you're a fellow math student or a math enthusiast looking to deepen your understanding of the Simplex Method.
