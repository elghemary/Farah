The simplex method is one of the best ways to optimize a real-life problem. As a mathematics undergraduate, this is how I first discovered this algorithm. However, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of the complicated calculations involved. First, It didn't make any sense, But everything changed when I started visualizing the calculations in terms of vectors and planes, everything click into place.

 In this Article, I want to share my understanding of the simplex method, and show you how to use Linear Algebra to think about it in an intuitive way. Whether you're a fellow math student or a math enthusiast looking to deepen your understanding of the Simplex Method.   

> Linear Programming is a generalization of Linear Algebra. It is capable of handling a variety of problems, ranging from ﬁnding schedules for airlines or movies in a theater to distributing oil from reﬁneries to markets. The reason for this great versatility is the ease at which constraints can be incorporated into the model\

Many real-life problems can be formulated as linear programs, hence LPs are a mathematical modeling technique to determine the best possible solution given a set of constraints and objectives. For example Maximizing the profit of a company, or minimize their production costs.

Let's Consider the following example of an LP
